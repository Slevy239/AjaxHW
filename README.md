## Description
This application utilizes the Giphy API to search and display gifs. There are pre-determined buttons that search the API depending on which button is active. By default, the application displays the first 10 gifs that are retrieved. The user is able to pause and play the gifs by simply clicking on them. The application appeals to the avid Philadelphia sports fan and the wholesome BOBAN fan with the current selection of buttons.
